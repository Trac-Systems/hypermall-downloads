# Hypermall

This is the release page for Hypermall installables.

## What is Hypermall?

Hypermall is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer trading experience for Bitcoin assets of the TAP Protocol.

- DeFi-ready: trade assets from other chains like Ethereum, Cardano and Tron (Runes, BRC20 coming soon).
- RWA-ready: RWA assets becoming integral to Hypermall's interop layer.
- Secure: Hypermall runs as native app in the trader's user space, no wallet connections to 3rd party sites required.
- Ground breaking: contracts run inside the app. Every particpant can be sure their transactions are executed first on their machines.
- Built on Trac Network, a blockchain-less L1 with focus on _speed_ and _interopability_.
